# Authentication and RLS Fixes - Completed

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. Email Verification Removed
- **Problem**: Users were stuck waiting for email confirmation
- **Solution**: Modified `AuthProvider.tsx` to remove `emailRedirectTo` and set `needsEmailConfirmation: false`
- **Result**: Users can now sign up and login immediately without email verification

### 2. Signup Flow Improved
- **Problem**: Signup required email confirmation and showed "waiting for verification"
- **Solution**: Updated `LoginPage.tsx` to redirect immediately after successful signup
- **Result**: Seamless signup experience with instant access

### 3. Profile Creation Enhanced
- **Problem**: Profiles weren't being created consistently
- **Solution**: Added `profile-utils.ts` with robust profile creation functions
- **Result**: Profiles are created automatically and reliably

### 4. RLS Policies Fixed
- **Problem**: Groups and other features were blocked by restrictive RLS policies
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive SQL fix in `sql/fix-signup-and-rls.sql`
- **Result**: Users can access groups and other features without permission errors
