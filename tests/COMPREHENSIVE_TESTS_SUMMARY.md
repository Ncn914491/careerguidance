## Test Architecture

### Mock-Based Testing Strategy
All tests use comprehensive mocking to:
- Avoid dependencies on external services (Supabase, Gemini AI)
- Ensure consistent test execution
- Focus on business logic validation
- Enable fast test execution

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component and function testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Feature interaction and workflow testing
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user journey validation
4. **Performance Tests**: Large dataset and concurrent operation handling
5. **Security Tests**: Access control and data isolation validation

### Coverage Areas

#### Requirements Validation
All tests validate against specific requirements from `requirements.md`:
- Requirement 5: Group chat functionality (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)
- Requirement 6: AI chatbot integration (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4)
- Requirement 7: Admin request workflow (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)
- Requirement 9: Testing and quality assurance (9.1, 9.2)

#### Error Handling
- Network failures and recovery
- Database connection issues
- API service unavailability
- Invalid input validation
- Authentication and authorization failures

#### Performance Testing
- Large message histories (50+ messages)
- Multiple concurrent users
- Bulk operations
- Real-time message broadcasting
- Database query optimization

#### Security Testing
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policy enforcement
- User data isolation
- Admin privilege validation
- Request processing authorization
- Audit trail verification

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all comprehensive tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/(api|integration|e2e)/"

# Run specific test suites
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/api/askai.test.ts"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/integration/groups-realtime-comprehensive.test.ts"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/integration/admin-request-workflow-comprehensive.test.ts"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/e2e/user-journeys.test.ts"
```
