# Database and System Fixes Applied

This document outlines all the fixes that have been applied to resolve authentication, profile creation, RLS policy, and admin functionality issues.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Profile Creation Issues**
- **Problem**: Users couldn't create profiles after signup
- **Solution**: Created automatic profile creation trigger
- **Files**: `sql/comprehensive-fix.sql`

### 2. **RLS Policy Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Conflicting Row-Level Security policies preventing data access
- **Solution**: Cleaned up and recreated all RLS policies with proper permissions
- **Files**: `sql/comprehensive-fix.sql`

### 3. **Admin Access Issues**
- **Problem**: Admin users couldn't access admin-only features
- **Solution**: Fixed admin role checking and created helper functions
- **Files**: `sql/comprehensive-fix.sql`, `src/app/api/weeks/route.ts`

### 4. **Missing API Endpoints**
- **Problem**: Weeks API endpoint was missing
- **Solution**: Created complete weeks API with proper validation
- **Files**: `src/app/api/weeks/route.ts`

### 5. **Test File Issues**
- **Problem**: Duplicate imports and missing dependencies in test files
- **Solution**: Fixed all import statements and test structure
- **Files**: `tests/integration/weeks-admin-core.test.ts`, `tests/integration/weeks-workflow.test.ts`

### 6. **Storage Configuration**
- **Problem**: File upload storage not properly configured
- **Solution**: Added storage bucket creation and policies
- **Files**: `sql/comprehensive-fix.sql`

## 🔐 Security Improvements

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- All tables have proper RLS policies
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have elevated permissions
- Service role has full access for system operations

### File Upload Security
- File type validation (images, videos, PDFs only)
- File size limits (50MB max)
- Secure storage with public URLs
- Admin-only upload permissions

### Authentication
- Automatic profile creation
- Role-based access control
- Secure admin promotion system
- Proper session management

## 📊 System Architecture

### Database Tables
- `profiles` - User profiles with roles
- `weeks` - Weekly content
- `week_files` - File attachments
- `schools` - School information
- `groups` - Group chat system
- `group_members` - Group membership
- `group_messages` - Chat messages
- `ai_chats` - AI conversations
- `admin_requests` - Admin role requests

### Storage
- `week-files` bucket for file uploads
- Public access for viewing
- Admin-only upload permissions

### API Routes
- `/api/weeks` - Week management (GET, POST)
- Authentication middleware
- File upload handling
- Proper error responses

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Run: `npm run db:fix`
   - Check RLS policies are applied

2. **"Profile not found" errors**
   - Ensure profile creation trigger is active
   - Check user exists in auth.users

3. **Admin access denied**
   - Create admin user: `npm run admin:create <email>`
   - Verify user role in profiles table

4. **File upload fails**
   - Check storage bucket exists
   - Verify storage policies
   - Ensure user has admin role

### Verification Steps

```bash
# 1. Test database connection
npm run db:test

# 2. Check admin users
npm run admin:create --list

# 3. Verify API endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/api/weeks

# 4. Test file upload (as admin)
# Use the admin panel at /admin
```

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Efficient RLS policies
- Optimized file storage
- Proper error handling
- Connection pooling ready
