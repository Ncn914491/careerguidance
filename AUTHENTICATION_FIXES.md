# Authentication System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Page Hanging Issue
- **Problem**: Login page was getting stuck in "please wait" state due to improper loading state management
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed loading state handling in `signIn` and `signUp` methods
  - Ensured loading state is properly reset on both success and error
  - Improved error handling with specific error messages

### 2. Authentication Context Consistency
- **Problem**: Race conditions and inconsistent state management across components
- **Solution**:
  - Updated AuthProvider to immediately set user/session data on successful auth
  - Fixed auth store hydration with proper client-side rehydration
  - Removed sensitive data from persistent storage (only storing lastActivity)

### 3. API Route Authentication
- **Problem**: API routes not properly handling Supabase sessions
- **Solution**:
  - Created `authenticatedFetch` utility for client-side API calls
  - Updated auth-client.ts to use proper SSR client for server-side auth
  - Added `getUserFromAuthHeader` for Bearer token authentication
  - Updated API routes to use proper authentication methods

### 4. State Management Issues
- **Problem**: Auth store was persisting sensitive data and causing hydration issues
- **Solution**:
  - Removed user/session data from persistence
  - Added proper store hydration on client-side
  - Improved state reset functionality

## Files Modified

### Core Authentication Files
- `src/components/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` - Fixed loading states and session handling
- `src/store/authStore.ts` - Improved persistence and hydration
- `src/lib/auth-client.ts` - Added proper SSR authentication utilities
- `src/lib/api-client.ts` - New utility for authenticated API calls

### UI Components
- `src/components/features/LoginPage/LoginPage.tsx` - Fixed hanging login states
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Updated to use authenticated API calls
- `src/app/api/weeks/route.ts` - Fixed API authentication

### Testing
- `scripts/test-auth.js` - Basic authentication test script

## Key Improvements

1. **No More Hanging**: Login/logout operations now complete properly without freezing
2. **Consistent State**: User authentication state is properly propagated across all components
3. **Secure API Calls**: All authenticated API calls now properly pass session tokens
4. **Better Error Handling**: Specific error messages for different authentication failures
5. **Proper Redirects**: Admin vs student users are correctly redirected to their respective dashboards

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Connection Test
```bash
node scripts/test-auth.js
```

### 2. Manual Testing Steps

#### Login Flow
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Try logging in with invalid credentials - should show proper error
3. Try logging in with valid credentials - should redirect without hanging
4. Verify user lands on correct dashboard (admin vs student)

#### Logout Flow
1. Click logout from any authenticated page
2. Should immediately redirect to login page
3. Should not be able to access protected routes

#### API Authentication
1. Try uploading content as admin - should work with proper authentication
2. Try accessing admin routes as non-admin - should be denied
3. Check browser network tab to verify Authorization headers are sent

#### State Persistence
1. Login and refresh the page - should remain logged in
2. Close browser and reopen - should remain logged in (if session is valid)
3. Logout and refresh - should remain logged out

## Environment Requirements

Ensure these environment variables are set in `.env.local`:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (for admin operations)

## Next Steps

1. Test the authentication flow thoroughly
2. Monitor for any remaining edge cases
3. Consider adding session refresh logic for long-running sessions
4. Add proper loading states for all API operations
5. Consider implementing session timeout warnings

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Still hanging on login**: Check browser console for errors, verify Supabase connection
2. **API calls failing**: Verify session tokens are being passed correctly
3. **Redirect issues**: Check that user roles are properly set in the database
4. **State inconsistency**: Clear browser storage and try again

The authentication system should now be much more reliable and consistent across the application.
