# Groups Dashboard Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Required Error
**Problem**: Groups API routes were not properly handling authentication headers, causing "Authentication required" errors even for logged-in users.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `ManageGroups.tsx` to use the authenticated API client (`src/lib/api.ts`)
- Fixed all API calls to include proper Authorization headers
- Updated `useSupabaseQuery.ts` to use authenticated API calls

### 2. Mixed Admin/Student Dashboards
**Problem**: Both admin and student users saw the same groups interface without role-based functionality.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `GroupsSidebar.tsx` with role-based rendering
- Added `isAdmin` prop to distinguish between admin and student views
- Admin users now see edit/delete buttons for all groups
- Students see a clean interface focused on joining and viewing groups

### 3. Missing Admin Functions
**Problem**: No edit/delete functionality available in the main groups interface.

**Solution**:
- Added edit/delete buttons for admin users in `GroupsSidebar.tsx`
- Created PUT route for updating groups (`/api/groups/[id]/route.ts`)
- Added inline editing functionality in the sidebar
- Implemented proper confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### 4. API Route Enhancements
**Problem**: Missing API endpoints and insufficient role-based access control.

**Solution**:
- Added PUT route for updating groups
- Created `/api/groups/[id]/leave/route.ts` for leaving groups
- Enhanced all routes with proper admin role checking
- Improved error handling and response messages

## Database Policy Updates

The `sql/fix-groups-policies.sql` file contains important policy updates:

1. **Groups Visibility**: Everyone can now view all groups (required for the groups list)
2. **Admin Controls**: Only admins can update/delete groups
3. **Member Management**: Users can leave groups, admins can manage all memberships
4. **Role Column**: Added role column to group_members table for future enhancements

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Apply Database Changes
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor
\i sql/fix-groups-policies.sql
```

### 2. Test Admin Functionality
1. Login as an admin user
2. Navigate to `/groups`
3. Verify you see the "Admin" badge in the header
4. Test creating a new group
5. Test editing an existing group (pencil icon)
6. Test deleting a group (trash icon)
7. Verify you can join/leave groups

### 3. Test Student Functionality
1. Login as a student user
2. Navigate to `/groups`
3. Verify you don't see edit/delete buttons
4. Test joining available groups
5. Test leaving joined groups
6. Verify group chat access works

### 4. Test Dashboard Integration
1. Admin: Navigate to `/admin/dashboard` → Groups tab
2. Student: Navigate to `/student/dashboard` → Study Groups tab
3. Verify both interfaces work properly
4. Test the "Manage Groups" functionality in admin dashboard

### 5. Test API Authentication
1. Open browser dev tools → Network tab
2. Perform group operations (create, edit, delete, join, leave)
3. Verify all requests include Authorization headers
4. Verify no "Authentication required" errors

## Environment Requirements

Ensure these environment variables are set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see "Authentication required" errors:
1. Check that the user is properly logged in
2. Verify the session token is being passed in API calls
3. Check browser console for any authentication errors
4. Ensure Supabase environment variables are correct

### If admin controls don't appear:
1. Verify the user's role is set to 'admin' in the profiles table
2. Check that `isAdmin` prop is being passed correctly
3. Ensure the AuthProvider is properly checking user roles

### If group operations fail:
1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify the database policies are applied correctly
3. Ensure the user has the necessary permissions

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with both admin and student accounts
2. **Monitor** for any remaining authentication issues
3. **Consider** adding more granular permissions (group moderators, etc.)
4. **Implement** real-time updates for group membership changes
5. **Add** group member management interface for admins

The groups functionality should now work seamlessly with proper role-based access control and no authentication errors.
