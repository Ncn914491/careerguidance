### 3. Fixed Weeks Editing Crash and "Failed to Load Weeks" Error
- **Issue**: Weeks editing was causing crashes and showing "failed to load weeks" error
- **Root Cause**: Poor error handling in refetch mechanism causing UI to clear and loading states interfering
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved state management by updating local state immediately after successful API calls
  - Only refetch on errors for data consistency
  - Better error handling with proper TypeScript types
  - Fixed refetch function to be more robust with optional loading parameter

  - `src/components/features/WeeksPage/WeeksPage.tsx`
  - `src/app/api/weeks/[id]/route.ts`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

### 4. Made Statistics Page Dynamic with Real Analytics
- **Issue**: Statistics showing static "0" values instead of dynamic data
- **Root Cause**: Statistics components not using authenticated API calls
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated AdminStats and StudentStats components to use proper authenticated headers
  - Verified that API routes already fetch dynamic data from database
  - Fixed authentication calls to ensure proper data retrieval
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/components/features/AdminDashboard/AdminStats.tsx`
  - `src/components/features/StudentDashboard/StudentStats.tsx`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
